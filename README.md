## Instructions to run the application

### Prerequisite:
1. Clone the repository using gitHub link: [Stock-Portfolio-Suggestion-Engine](https://github.com/eshasah/Stock-Portfolio-Suggestion-Engine.git)
2. Or unzip the file sent in email.
3. Environment set-up:
    - Have npm installed in your machine.
    - Have a Python environment setup in your machine. Use an IDE which supports running of React js and Python projects. (We have used VS code for project development)
    - Open terminal for the **frontend** folder of the project and run command: `npm install`
    - Ensure that Python is accessible through the project folder. Open terminal in the **backend** folder of the project and run command: `python â€“version`
4. Browser set-up:
    - Since we were facing some Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors, we have found a work around to solve it. However it is working in Google Chrome.
    - Please download [Moesif CORS extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc?hl=en-US).
    - Enable the extension, ensure that extension is active when the application is running.
  
### Running the application:
- In VS code:
  1. Load the project in IDE  by opening the project folder.
  2. For frontend: open terminal and navigate to frontend folder using command: `cd frontend`
  3. Then run the react application with command: `npm start`
  4. For backend: open another terminal and navigate to backend folder using command: `cd backend`
  5. Then run the python application using command: `python api.py`
- Without IDE:
  1. Open the project folder using the **file explorer** of your machine.
  2. Open **two terminals** on the project folder and follow the **steps ii through v** in section **In VS code**.
